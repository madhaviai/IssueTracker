# AI-Powered Issue Tracker

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Issue Tracker** — a tool designed to help individuals, teams, and organizations track and visualize the journey of their issues, from inception to resolution, and beyond.

## 🌱 About

This project is a public, open-source effort to help you **track**, **stage**, and **version** the issues you face — whether they're personal, professional, or organizational. The goal is to provide clarity through visualization, promote structured thinking, and enable reflective decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Stage-Based Tracking**: Every issue goes through well-defined stages — from the initial stage to subsequent stages.
* **Graph/Tree Visualization**: View your **issue journey** and **solution paths** using dynamic visual graphs.
* **Versioning Support**: Treat each issue like a versioned entity — evolve or fork it as life changes.
* **Reflective Issue Management**: Use past issues and solutions to guide future ones.
* **AI Assistance (Planned)**: Future versions will include intelligent suggestions, path recommendations, and solution pattern recognition.

## 🔄 Use Cases

* Personal productivity and thought organization
* Mental wellness tracking
* Team/organization retrospectives and continuous improvement
* Root cause analysis and decision logging
* Project management and blocker resolution

## 📌 Vision

> Life is full of issues — big and small — that we face every day. This tool aims to make those issues visible, traceable, and solvable.

By visualizing your issue path, you'll be able to **see how you solved things in the past**, **learn from it**, and **create new issues based on resolved ones** — much like leveling up a character in a story.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
